abstract = {Many multirotor Unmanned Aerial Systems applications have a critical need for precise position control in environments with strong dynamic external disturbances such as wind gusts or ground and wall effects. Moreover, to maximize flight time, small multirotor platforms have to operate within strict constraints on payload and thus computational performance. In this paper, we present the design and experimental comparison of Model Predictive and PID multirotor position controllers augmented with a disturbance estimator to reject strong wind gusts up to 12 m/s and ground effect. For disturbance estimation, we compare Extended and Unscented Kalman filtering. In extensive in- and outdoor flight tests, we evaluate the suitability of the developed control and estimation algorithms to run on a computationally constrained platform. This allows to draw a conclusion on whether potential performance improvements justify the increased computational complexity of MPC for multirotor position control and UKF for disturbance estimation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift (or embed) the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to numerical approximations of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and apply the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) to compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form of a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple – it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system with the same number of control inputs and the same dimension of the state-space. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. We treat both the full-state measurement case and the input–output case, as well as systems with disturbances/noise. Numerical examples demonstrate the approach.1},

abstract = {A simple algorithm is developed for unbiased parameter identification of autoregressive (AR) signals subject to white measurement noise. It is shown that the corrupting noise variance, which determines the bias in the standard least-squares (LS) parameter estimator, can be estimated by simply using the expected LS errors when the ratio between the driving noise variance and the corrupting noise variance is known or obtainable in some way. Then an LS-based algorithm is established via the principle of bias compensation. Compared with the other LS-based algorithms recently developed, the introduced algorithm requires fewer computations and has a simpler algorithmic structure. Moreover, it can produce better AR parameter estimates whenever a reasonable guess of the noise variance ratio is available.},

abstract = {This study employs system identification using the Extended Kalman Filter to investigate variations in the stiffness and damping of shallow foundations during earthquakes. System identification results showed that the elastic stiffness of different foundations was significantly smaller than specifications proposed by FEMA 356 for the SE site class. As the earthquake load increased, a partial uplift of the foundation occurred. Following this uplift, the time domain inelastic stiffness decreased due to variations in contact area between the foundation and sub-soil. The inelastic stiffness at the maximum response was less than the elastic stiffness, according to the effective peak ground acceleration (EPGA) and the contact area ratio. After uplift in the foundation, the EPGA increased, the contact area ratio decreased, and the damping ratio increased by up to 20%. On the basis of these system identification results, we determined relationships between elastic stiffness and the ratio of bearing stress demand to the soil-foundation system capacity.},

As a second step, the optimal values of the above covariance matrices are injected in our speed–rotor flux estimation loop (on-line). Computer simulations of the speed and rotor flux estimation have been performed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

abstract = {Accurately modeling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of complex ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and the Belousov Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

abstract = {First principles modeling of physical systems has led to significant technological advances across all branches of science. For nonlinear systems, however, small modeling errors can lead to significant deviations from the true, measured behavior. Even in mechanical systems, where the equations are assumed to be well-known, there are often model discrepancies corresponding to nonlinear friction, wind resistance, etc. Discovering models for these discrepancies remains an open challenge for many complex systems. In this work, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to discover a model for the discrepancy between a simplified model and measurement data. In particular, we assume that the model mismatch can be sparsely represented in a library of candidate model terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several examples including experimental data from a double pendulum on a cart. We further design and implement a feed-forward controller in simulations, showing improvement with a discrepancy model.},

abstract = {Recent applications of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to precision agriculture have shown increased ease and efficiency in data collection at precise remote locations. However, further enhancement of the field requires operation over long periods of time, for example, days or weeks. This has so far been impractical due to the limited flight times of such platforms and the requirement of humans in the loop for operation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully autonomous rotorcraft UAS that is capable of performing repeated flights for long-term observation missions without any human intervention. We address two key technologies that are critical for such a system: full platform autonomy to enable mission execution independently from human operators and the ability of vision-based precision landing on a recharging station for automated energy replenishment. High-level autonomous decision making is implemented as a hierarchy of master and slave state machines. Vision-based precision landing is enabled by estimating the landing pad's pose using a bundle of AprilTag fiducials configured for detection from a wide range of altitudes. We provide an extensive evaluation of the landing pad pose estimation accuracy as a function of the bundle's geometry. The functionality of the complete system is demonstrated through two indoor experiments with duration of 11 and 10.6 hr, and one outdoor experiment with a duration of 4 hr. The UAS executed 16, 48, and 22 flights, respectively, during these experiments. In the outdoor experiment, the ratio between flying to collect data and charging was 1–10, which is similar to past work in this domain. All flights were fully autonomous with no human in the loop. To our best knowledge, this is the first research publication about the long-term outdoor operation of a quadrotor system with no human interaction.},

The control-oriented models have parameters which are not constant over the whole operating range but are simple to parametrize. The models based on physics have a good precision, but they are not suitable for controller design. To combine the positive aspects of both model types, a physical model of the wall-wetting system whose parameters can be adjusted on-line with the aid of extended Kalman filtering was developed.

abstract = {Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are increasingly being used for aerial transportation in remote and urban spaces where portability can be exploited to reach previously inaccessible and inhospitable spaces. Current approaches to MAV swung payload system path planning have primarily focused on pre-generating (agile) collision-free, or conservative minimal-swing trajectories in static environments. However, these approaches have failed to address the prospect of online re-planning in uncertain and dynamic environments which is a prerequisite for real-world deployability. This article describes a novel Non-Linear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) for online, agile and closed-loop local trajectory planning and control addressing the limitations mentioned of contemporary approaches. We integrate the controller in a full system framework and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in simulation and experimental studies. Results show the scalability and adaptability of our method to various dynamic setups with repeatable performance over several complex tasks which include flying through a narrow opening and avoiding moving humans.},

Input voltage is modeled as an Ornstein- Uhlenbeck (O.U.) process to account both, the white noise and Brownian process. State space model of the circuit has been obtained using Enz-Krummenacher-Vittoz (EKV) model of the MOSFET circuit and Kirchhoff's current law (KCL). The proposed method has the following advantages (i) It can be used for any mode of transistor operation besides near the quiescent point region. The nonlinearity in saturation can be considered in the proposed method. (ii) The method can be used for large amplitude input signal. For small amplitude input signal, Kalman filter (KF) can be used, which results in inaccurate estimation due to linearization of nonlinear system. (iii) The method presents real time parameter estimation, as EKF has been used for nonlinear system. It is able to track the parameters, when they are slowly changing with time. (iv) Use of Kronecker product presents more accurate representation of nonlinear system. The proposed method has been compared with Kronecker based wavelet transform (WT) representation of the system. The wavelet coefficients have been obtained using perturbation technique. Finally, the least mean square (LMS) has been applied to the wavelet transform representation of the system for parameter estimation.

The movement of the suspended payload influences the dynamics of the multirotor, which must be appropriately handled by the controller to achieve satisfactory tracking results. We derive a mathematical model of the interconnected multi-body system using Kane's equations, and develop a non-linear tracking controller based on the backstepping technique. In addition to suppressing the effects of the swinging payload, the controller also compensates for an unknown constant wind disturbance. The origin of the tracking error is proven UGAS (Uniformly Globally Asymptotically Stable) and ULES (Uniformly Locally Exponentially Stable) through Lyapunov analysis. To reduce the swing motion of the suspended load, a nominal swing-free path is generated through open loop shaping filters, then further perturbed through a delayed feedback approach from measured load deflection angles to achieve robustness.

Starting from the equations of motion of the coupled slung load system, an observation model is derived to autonomously measure the swing angle by means of the data available from the onboard IMU, without the need to rely on extra sensors. Provided the multicopter is subject to known control inputs, data-fusion is performed through a Fading Gaussian Deterministic approach, whose theoretical background was recently investigated by the author. In particular, the algorithm is based on a two-step set of equations derived from the minimization of a cost function where earlier data are progressively de-weighted by a fading factor, making the estimation less prone to problem unknowns. The validity of the approach is investigated by means of numerical simulations, where a tuning criterion is shown to provide the fading factor that best dampens the modeling errors with respect to the measurement noise. Estimated swing angles are then used in a sample feedback control application with the aim to simultaneously perform trajectory tracking and payload swing damping.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.},

abstract = {Many multirotor Unmanned Aerial Systems applications have a critical need for precise position control in environments with strong dynamic external disturbances such as wind gusts or ground and wall effects. Moreover, to maximize flight time, small multirotor platforms have to operate within strict constraints on payload and thus computational performance. In this paper, we present the design and experimental comparison of Model Predictive and PID multirotor position controllers augmented with a disturbance estimator to reject strong wind gusts up to 12 m/s and ground effect. For disturbance estimation, we compare Extended and Unscented Kalman filtering. In extensive in- and outdoor flight tests, we evaluate the suitability of the developed control and estimation algorithms to run on a computationally constrained platform. This allows to draw a conclusion on whether potential performance improvements justify the increased computational complexity of MPC for multirotor position control and UKF for disturbance estimation.},

Rather than relying on the inherent robustness properties of standard NMPC, the developed technique explicitly account for the transient effect of parametric estimation error by combining a parameter adjustment mechanism with robust MPC algorithms. The parameter estimation routine employed guarantees non-increase of the estimation error vector. This means that the controller employs a process model which approaches that of the true system over time.

Building on the recent development of the Koopman model predictive control framework [14], we propose a methodology for closed-loop feedback control of nonlinear partial differential equations in a fully data-driven and model-free manner. In the first step, we compute a Koopman-linear representation of the system using a variation of the extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm and then we apply the model predictive control to the constructed linear model. Our methodology is also capable of utilizing sparse measurements by incorporating delay-embedding of the available data into the identification and control processes. We illustrate the application of this methodology for the periodic Burgers' equation and the boundary control of fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional cavity.},

abstract = {We propose a general dynamic reduced-order modelling framework for typical experimental data: time-resolved sensor data and optional non-time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) snapshots. This framework can be decomposed into four building blocks. First, the sensor signals are lifted to a dynamic feature space without false neighbours. Second, we identify a sparse human-interpretable nonlinear dynamical system for the feature state based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Third, if PIV snapshots are available, a local linear mapping from the feature state to the velocity field is performed to reconstruct the full state of the system. Fourth, a generalized feature-based modal decomposition identifies coherent structures that are most dynamically correlated with the linear and nonlinear interaction terms in the sparse model, adding interpretability. Steps 1 and 2 define a black-box model. Optional steps 3 and 4 lift the black-box dynamics to a grey-box model in terms of the identified coherent structures, if non-time-resolved full-state data are available. This grey-box modelling strategy is successfully applied to the transient and post-transient laminar cylinder wake, and compares favourably with a proper orthogonal decomposition model. We foresee numerous applications of this highly flexible modelling strategy, including estimation, prediction and control. Moreover, the feature space may be based on intrinsic coordinates, which are unaffected by a key challenge of modal expansion: the slow change of low-dimensional coherent structures with changing geometry and varying parameters.},

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of complex ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and the Belousov Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

In the identification parts of both algorithms the process model is approximated by a seriesparallel neural network structure which is trained by a recursive least squares (ARLS) method. The two control algorithms have been applied to: 1) the temperature control of a fluidized bed furnace reactor (FBFR) of a pilot plant and 2) the auto-pilot control of an F-16 aircraft.

abstract = {The current manuscript presents the longitudinal and lateral directional online parameter estimation of two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using sequential Least Squares formulation in frequency domain. The two fixed wing UAVs share a similar cropped delta planform and differ in their cross sectional geometries, one with a rectangular and the other being a reflex airfoil cross sections respectively. Recursive Fourier Transform algorithm has been used to convert the flight data in time domain to frequency domain which is measured by means of a dedicated on-board data acquisition system capable of on-board logging and telemetry to ground station. The combination of Sequential Least Squares with Recursive Fourier Transform (SLS-RFT) in frequency domain can be used to carry out online parameter estimation. An attempt has been made to check the applicability of the current method to estimate parameters from the generated flight data of the two UAVs using both conventional as well as random control inputs. Results showed that the parameters estimated, using SLS-RFT, from the linear flight data are consistent and in close agreement with the obtained parameters from full scale wind tunnel testing of UAVs. It was also observed that the estimates from the manoeuvres with multistep control inputs converged faster compared to the parameters obtained from the manoeuvres with slow varying control surface deflections. The time varying linear aerodynamic parametric model of SLS-RFT was able to capture the dynamics of the flights with nonlinear aerodynamics. Certain limitations of the current online system identification method were also observed with estimating parameters from the flight data of UAVs performing near stall manoeuvres. The estimated parameters using SLS-RFT are also compared with the results obtained from batch methods namely classical Maximum Likelihood (ML) and neural based Neural–Gauss–Newton (NGN) methods.},

@article{Song1986,
abstract = {For a special class of systems, a general formulation and stochastic stability analysis of a new nonlinear filter, called the modified gain extended Kalman filter (MGEKF), is presented. Used as an observer, it is globally exponentially convergent. In the presence of uncertainties a nominal nonrealizable filter algorithm is developed for which global stochastic stability is proven. With respect to this nominal filter algorithm, conditions are obtained such that the effective deviations of the realizable filter are not destabilizing. In an appropriate coordinate frame, the parameter identification problem of a linear system is shown to be a member of this special class. For the example problems, the MGEKF shows superior convergence characteristics without evidence of instability. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

@article{Proctor2016,
abstract = {We develop a new method which extends dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to incorporate the effect of control to extract low-order models from high-dimensional, complex systems. DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations-only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

@article{Sadr2014,
abstract = {Nowadays, aerial robots or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have many applications in civilian and military fields. For example, of these applications is aerial monitoring, picking loads and moving them by different grippers. In this research, a quadrotor with a cable-suspended load with eight degrees of freedom is considered. The purpose is to control the position and attitude of the quadrotor on a desired trajectory in order to move the considered load with constant length of cable. So, the purpose of this research is proposing and designing an antiswing control algorithm for the suspended load. To this end, control and stabilization of the quadrotor are necessary for designing the antiswing controller. Furthermore, this paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, dynamics model is developed using Newton-Euler formulation, and obtained equations are verified in comparison with Lagrange approach. Consequently, a nonlinear control strategy based on dynamic model is used in order to control the position and attitude of the quadrotor. The performance of this proposed controller is evaluated by nonlinear simulations and, finally, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy for the quadrotor with suspended load in various maneuvers.},

@article{Nonomura2019,
abstract = {A new dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method is introduced for simultaneous system identification and denoising in conjunction with the adoption of an extended Kalman filter algorithm. The present paper explains the extended-Kalman-filter-based DMD (EKFDMD) algorithm which is an online algorithm for dataset for a small number of degree of freedom (DoF). It also illustrates that EKFDMD requires significant numerical resources for many-degree-of-freedom (many-DoF) problems and that the combination with truncated proper orthogonal decomposition (trPOD) helps us to apply the EKFDMD algorithm to many-DoF problems, though it prevents the algorithm from being fully online. The numerical experiments of a noisy dataset with a small number of DoFs illustrate that EKFDMD can estimate eigenvalues better than or as well as the existing algorithms, whereas EKFDMD can also denoise the original dataset online. In particular, EKFDMD performs better than existing algorithms for the case in which system noise is present. The EKFDMD with trPOD, which unfortunately is not fully online, can be successfully applied to many-DoF problems, including a fluid-problem example, and the results reveal the superior performance of system identification and denoising.},
