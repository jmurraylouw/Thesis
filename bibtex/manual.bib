abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon: in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms are computationally intensive optimization based control techniques. Their complexity significantly increases when the cost function prediction horizon increases. This problem is more pronounced when applying this techniques to systems having fast dynamics, in this case the prediction horizon length is limited by the calculation power of the processor. The use of long prediction horizons should provide healthier results than single prediction horizon yet prediction horizon equal to one are widely used for the control of electrical system and are achieving beneficial results. This paper proves mathematically that in some special cases of MPC applied to first order systems the use of a prediction horizon equal to one is similar to the use of a prediction horizon greater than one. An MPC algorithm is then applied for the control of the current of an RL load driven by an H-Bridge, multiple prediction horizon are used and results are compared.},

abstract = {Many systems of interest are exceedingly high dimensional, making them difficult to characterize. High dimensionality also limits controller robustness due to significant computational time delays. For example, for the governing equations of fluid dynamics, the resulting discretized equations may have millions or billions of degrees of freedom, making them expensive to simulate. Thus, significant effort has gone into obtaining reduced-order models that capture the most relevant mechanisms and are suitable for feedback control. Unlike reduced-order models based on proper orthogonal decomposition (see Chapters 11 and 12), which order modes based on energy content in the data, here we will discuss a class of balanced reduced-order models that employ a different inner product to order modes based on input-output energy. Thus, only modes that are both highly controllable and highly observable are selected, making balanced models ideal for control applications. In this chapter we also describe related procedures for model reduction and system identification , depending on whether or not the user starts with a high-fidelity model or simply has access to measurement data. 9.1 Model Reduction and System Identification In many nonlinear systems, it is still possible to use linear control techniques. For example, in fluid dynamics there are numerous success stories of linear model-based flow control [27, 180, 94], for example to delay transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a spatially developing boundary layer, to reduce skin-friction drag in wall turbulence, and to stabilize the flow past an open cavity. However, many linear control approaches do not scale well to large state spaces, and they may be prohibitively expensive to enact for real-time control on short timescales. Thus, it is often necessary to develop low-dimensional approximations of the system for use in real-time feedback control. There are two broad approaches to obtain reduced-order models (ROMs): First, it is possible to start with a high-dimensional system, such as the discretized Navier-Stokes equations, and project the dynamics onto a low-dimensional subspace identified, for example , using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD; Chapter 11) [57, 251] and Galerkin projection [441, 53]. There are numerous variations to this procedure, including the discrete empirical interpolation methods (DEIM; Section 12.5) [127, 419], gappy POD (Sec-tion 12.1) [179], balanced proper orthogonal decomposition (BPOD; Section 9.2) [554, 458], and many more. The second approach is to collect data from a simulation or an experiment and identify a low-rank model using data-driven techniques. This approach is typically called system identification, and is often preferred for control design because of the relative ease of implementation. Examples include the dynamic mode decomposition 321},

The outer control system is designed by means of a robust tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy, which is used to control the UAV's planar motion and stabilize the suspended load. For the inner control system, the input-output feedback linearization (IOFL) technique combined with the dynamic extension approach and a discrete mixed H2/H∞ controller is considered to control the UAV's altitude and attitude.

abstract = {A filtering technique based on a set of recursive equations is analyzed and applied to swing angle estimation for multicopter slung load applications. Starting from the equations of motion of the coupled slung load system, an observation model is derived to autonomously measure the swing angle by means of the data available from the onboard IMU, without the need to rely on extra sensors. Provided the multicopter is subject to known control inputs, data-fusion is performed through a Fading Gaussian Deterministic approach, whose theoretical background was recently investigated by the author. In particular, the algorithm is based on a two-step set of equations derived from the minimization of a cost function where earlier data are progressively de-weighted by a fading factor, making the estimation less prone to problem unknowns. The validity of the approach is investigated by means of numerical simulations, where a tuning criterion is shown to provide the fading factor that best dampens the modeling errors with respect to the measurement noise. Estimated swing angles are then used in a sample feedback control application with the aim to simultaneously perform trajectory tracking and payload swing damping.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of trajectory tracking of a multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle carrying a suspended payload. The movement of the suspended payload influences the dynamics of the multirotor, which must be appropriately handled by the controller to achieve satisfactory tracking results. We derive a mathematical model of the interconnected multi-body system using Kane's equations, and develop a non-linear tracking controller based on the backstepping technique. In addition to suppressing the effects of the swinging payload, the controller also compensates for an unknown constant wind disturbance. The origin of the tracking error is proven UGAS (Uniformly Globally Asymptotically Stable) and ULES (Uniformly Locally Exponentially Stable) through Lyapunov analysis. To reduce the swing motion of the suspended load, a nominal swing-free path is generated through open loop shaping filters, then further perturbed through a delayed feedback approach from measured load deflection angles to achieve robustness. The proposed controller structure is verified by simulations and experiments.},

abstract = {Residual vibration suppression in freely suspended payload transports has been the focus of extensive work in the past. Many methods have been used to address this problem, including both open-loop motion planning and closed-loop control techniques. However, to be effective, most of these methods require linearization of the system and, in turn, have been restricted in their maneuver speeds. The inherent nonlinearity of suspended payload systems suggests the need for a more rigorous method, where the complete dynamic description can be retained throughout the optimization. Dynamic programming (DP) is such a method. This paper will outline the development of the DP algorithm for a discrete time system as well as its application to the rapid transport of a doubly suspended payload, a nonlinear system. The system consists of a long slender payload, suspended by a cable at each end. The two cables are each held by an independent robot manipulator. We will show that DP is effective at reducing residual oscillations for nonlinear systems, as demonstrated by both simulations and experimental validation. Residual oscillations were suppressed to less than 5% of their original magnitudes.},

Building on the recent development of the Koopman model predictive control framework [14], we propose a methodology for closed-loop feedback control of nonlinear partial differential equations in a fully data-driven and model-free manner. In the first step, we compute a Koopman-linear representation of the system using a variation of the extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm and then we apply the model predictive control to the constructed linear model. Our methodology is also capable of utilizing sparse measurements by incorporating delay-embedding of the available data into the identification and control processes. We illustrate the application of this methodology for the periodic Burgers' equation and the boundary control of fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional cavity.},

abstract = {This paper presents the problem of safe and fast transportation of packages by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) kind quadrotor. A mathematical model and a control strategy for a special class of underactuated mechanical systems, composed of a quadrotor transporting a cable-suspended payload, are proposed. The Euler-Lagrange formulation is used to obtain the dynamic model of the system, where the integrated dynamics of the quadrotor, cable and payload are considered. An Interconnection and Damping Assignment-Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) is chosen because of its inherent robustness against parametric uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics. Two cases are considered to obtain two different control laws, in the first case, the designed control law depends on the swing angle of the payload, in the second case the control law does not depend on it. The control objective is to transport the payload from point to point, with swing reduction along trajectory. Experimental results using monocular vision based navigation are shown to evaluate the proposed control law.},

The use of error criteria in parameter estimation will be discussed, where the identified model is used in model predictive control (MPC).

A normal one-step-ahead prediction error criterion will be optimal for k-step-ahead prediction. Then it is argued that even when some bias exists, the result could still hold true. Therefore, for MPC identification of linear processes, one-step-ahead prediction error models fever k-step-ahead prediction models.

abstract = {Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.},

abstract = {The different types of drones can be differentiated in terms of the type (fixed-wing, multirotor, etc.), the degree of autonomy, the size and weight, and the power source. These specifications are important, for example for the drone's cruising range, the maximum flight duration, and the loading capacity. Aside from the drone itself (i.e., the ‘platform') various types of payloads can be dis- tinguished, including freight (e.g., mail parcels, medicines, fire extinguishing material, flyers, etc.) and different types of sensors (e.g., cameras, sniffers, mete- orological sensors, etc.). Applications of different payloads will be described. To perform a flight, drones have a need for (a certain amount of) wireless communication with a pilot on the ground. In addition, in most cases there is a need for communication with a payload, like a camera or a sensor. To allow this communication to take place frequency spectrum is required. The requirements for frequency spectrum depend on the type of drone, the flight characteristics, and the payload. Since frequency spectrum does not end at national borders, international coordination on the use of frequency spectrum is required. Legal issues on fre- quency spectrum usage and electronic equipment (national and international legal matters on frequency spectrum and equipment requirements) are discussed, as well as frequency spectrum and vulnerability (an insight in available frequency spectrum and associated risks in using the frequency spectrum) and surveillance and compliance (enforcement of frequency spectrum use, equipment requirements, and the need for international and European cooperation). Finally, future devel- opments in drone technology are discussed. The trend is for drones to become smaller, lighter, more efficient, and cheaper. As a result, drones will become increasingly available to the public at large and will be used for an increasing range of purposes. Drones will become increasingly autonomous and also more capable of operating in swarms.},

abstract = {Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational effciency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

abstract = {We develop a new method which extends dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to incorporate the effect of control to extract low-order models from high-dimensional, complex systems. DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations-only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

abstract = {We refer to Model Predictive Control (MPC) as that family of controllers in which there is a direct use of an explicit and separately identifiable model. Control design methods based on the MPC concept have found wide acceptance in industrial applications and have been studied by academia. The reason for such popularity is the ability of MPC designs to yield high performance control systems capable of operating without expert intervention for long periods of time. In this paper the issues of importance that any control system should address are stated. MPC techniques are then reviewed in the light of these issues in order to point out their advantages in design and implementation. A number of design techniques emanating from MPC, namely Dynamic Matrix Control, Model Algorithmic Control, Inferential Control and Internal Model Control, are put in perspective with respect to each other and the relation to more traditional methods like Linear Quadratic Control is examined. The flexible constraint handling capabilities of MPC are shown to be a significant advantage in the context of the overall operating objectives of the process industries and the 1-, 2-, and ∞-norm formulations of the performance objective are discussed. The application of MPC to non-linear systems is examined and it is shown that its main attractions carry over. Finally, it is explained that though MPC is not inherently more or less robust than classical feedback, it can be adjusted more easily for robustness. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {A novel data-driven modal decomposition of fluid flow is proposed, comprising key features of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The first mode is the normalized real or imaginary part of the DMD mode that minimizes the time-averaged residual. The th mode is defined recursively in an analogous manner based on the residual of an expansion using the first modes. The resulting recursive DMD (RDMD) modes are orthogonal by construction, retain pure frequency content and aim at low residual. Recursive DMD is applied to transient cylinder wake data and is benchmarked against POD and optimized DMD (Chen et al., J. Nonlinear Sci., vol. 22, 2012, pp. 887-915) for the same snapshot sequence. Unlike POD modes, RDMD structures are shown to have purer frequency content while retaining a residual of comparable order to POD. In contrast to DMD, with exponentially growing or decaying oscillatory amplitudes, RDMD clearly identifies initial, maximum and final fluctuation levels. Intriguingly, RDMD outperforms both POD and DMD in the limit-cycle resolution from the same snapshots. Robustness of these observations is demonstrated for other parameters of the cylinder wake and for a more complex wake behind three rotating cylinders. Recursive DMD is proposed as an attractive alternative to POD and DMD for empirical Galerkin models, in particular for nonlinear transient dynamics.},

Generally the control parameters of the onboard autopilot or stabilizer are tuned for a particular condition such as no payload or constant payload. Therefore, such mass change may significantly deteriorate the automatic control performance. In our work, a robust adaptive control method is proposed to deal with this challenging issue, aiming at 1) achieving a consistent performance for the altitude control of a quadcopter and 2) enhancing the robustness the system subject to signal noises. Using our custom built quadcopter platform as a case study, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed controller in terms of mass estimation, position tracking and velocity tracking via a series of simulations. Its superiority over the benchmark PID control is also highlighted via tracking performance comparison.},

abstract = {This paper presents planning and control algorithms for a multi-rotor with a suspended load. The suspended load cannot be controlled easily by the multi-rotor due to severe dynamic coupling between them. Difficulties are exacerbated by under-actuated, highly nonlinear nature of multi-rotor dynamics. Although many studies have been proposed to plan trajectories and control this system, there exist only a few reports on real-time trajectory generation. With this in mind, we propose a planning method which is capable of generating collision-free trajectories real-time and applicable to a high-dimensional nonlinear system. Using a differential flatness property, the system can be linearized entirely with elaborately chosen flat outputs. Convexification of non-convex constraints is carried out, and concave obstacle-avoidance constraints are converted to convex ones. After that, a convex optimization problem is solved to generate an optimal trajectory, but semi-feasible trajectory which considers only some parts of the initial state. We apply model predictive control with a sequential linear quadratic solver to compute a feasible collision-free trajectory and to control the system. Performance of the algorithm is validated by flight experiment.},

abstract = {We present the first perception-aware model predictive control framework for quadrotors that unifies control and planning with respect to action and perception objectives. Our framework leverages numerical optimization to compute trajectories that satisfy the system dynamics and require control inputs within the limits of the platform. Simultaneously, it optimizes perception objectives for robust and reliable sensing by maximizing the visibility of a point of interest and minimizing its velocity in the image plane. Considering both perception and action objectives for motion planning and control is challenging due to the possible conflicts arising from their respective requirements. For example, for a quadrotor to track a reference trajectory, it needs to rotate to align its thrust with the direction of the desired acceleration. However, the perception objective might require to minimize such rotation to maximize the visibility of a point of interest. A model-based optimization framework, able to consider both perception and action objectives and couple them through the system dynamics, is therefore necessary. Our perception-aware model predictive control framework works in a receding-horizon fashion by iteratively solving a non-linear optimization problem. It is capable of running in real-time, fully onboard our lightweight, small-scale quadrotor using a low-power ARM computer, together with a visual-inertial odometry pipeline. We validate our approach in experiments demonstrating (I) the conflict between perception and action objectives, and (II) improved behavior in extremely challenging lighting conditions.},

We model the flexible cable(s) as a finite series of links with spherical joints with mass concentrated at the end of each link. The resulting systems are thus high-dimensional with high degree-of-underactuation. For each of these systems, we show that the dynamics are differentially-flat, enabling planning of dynamically feasible trajectories. For the single quadrotor with a point-mass payload suspended through a flexible cable with five links (16 degrees-of-freedom and 12 degrees-of-underactuation), we use the coordinate-free dynamics to develop a geometric variation-based linearized equations of motion about a desired trajectory. We show that a finite-horizon linear quadratic regulator can be used to track a desired trajectory with a relatively large region of attraction.},

It is developed together with a slung load state estimator capable of estimating the slung load swing frequency. This means that the control system can adapt to an unknown wire length for the slung load. Simulations and flight tests show the effectiveness of the input shaping applied to a small scale autonomous helicopter slung load system. Both simulations and flight verifications shows significant slung load swing reduction using the proposed trajectory shaping over flight without. Indeed it is shown how the system is capable of performing almost completely swing-free maneuvers using the designed input shaper. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

The arm design is aimed to be light, foldable and energy-efficient. FRAD is designed with a scissor mechanism in a parallel arrangement actuated by a twisted string actuator (TSA) with a guide. The robot arm can fold, unfold, and easily deploy on drones by having benefit from inherent TSA advantages. We propose a linkage design approach to provide a solution to mechanical singularity and to improve a space-saving capability. The nonlinear pulling force of twisted strings' transmission ratio (decreasing with twisting) closely matched the typical force profile requirement for folding the arm. This fact was used in the foldable robot arm for its optimal actuation design. The required string torque and twist angle were calculated to generate a pulling force to fold the arm with a 0.3kg payload from the unfolded to the fully folded situation. Preliminary experimental trials demonstrated that the proposed FRAD could generate the required lifting force and fold the arm without a high torque motor.},

However, the conditions for the theorem to hold ignore the effects of noise and time-series analysis in practice requires a careful empirical determination of the sampling time and number of delays resulting in a number of delay coordinates larger than the minimum prescribed by Takens' theorem. In this paper, we use tools and ideas in Compressed Sensing to provide a first theoretical justification for the choice of the number of delays in noisy conditions. In particular, we show that under certain conditions on the dynamical system, linear measurement function, number of delays and sampling time, the delay-coordinate map can be a stable embedding of the dynamical systems attractor.},

abstract = {We develop an algorithm for model selection which allows for the consideration of a combinatorially large number of candidate models governing a dynamical system. The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model selection which typically limits the number of candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support, weak support or no support category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical systems, including a susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered disease model, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.},

Two of the main challenges remaining in DMD research are noise sensitivity and issues related to Krylov space closure when modeling nonlinear systems. Here, we investigate the combination of noise and nonlinearity in a controlled setting, by studying a class of systems with linear latent dynamics which are observed via multinomial observables. Our numerical models include system and measurement noise. We explore the influences of dataset metrics, the spectrum of the latent dynamics, the normality of the system matrix, and the geometry of the dynamics. Our results show that even for these very mildly nonlinear conditions, DMD methods often fail to recover the spectrum and can have poor predictive ability. Our work is motivated by our experience modeling multilegged robot data, where we have encountered great difficulty in reconstructing time series for oscillatory systems with slow transients, which decay only slightly faster than a period.},

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

abstract = {<p>The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam's razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.</p>},

Approximate linear representations of nonlinear dynamics have long been sought, driving considerable interest in Koopman theory. We present a universal, data-driven decomposition of chaos as an intermittently forced linear system. This work combines delay embedding and Koopman theory to decompose chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low-energy delay coordinates; this is called the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the Lorenz system and real-world examples including Earth's magnetic field reversal and measles outbreaks. In each case, forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare intermittent forcing that precedes switching and bursting phenomena. The forcing activity demarcates coherent phase space regions where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are s rongly nonlinear.},

abstract = {Reduced Hessian Successive Quadratic Programming (SQP) has been shown to be well suited for the solution of large-scale process optimization problems with many variables and constraints but only few degrees of freedom. The reduced space method involves four major steps: an initial preprocessing phase followed by an iterative procedure which requires the solution of a set of linear equalities, the QP subproblem and a line search. Clearly, the overall performance of the algorithm will depend directly on the robustness and computational efficiency of the techniques used to handle each of these sub-tasks. The preprocessing phase solves a linear feasibility problem corresponding to the original nonlinear programming formulation. This step serves to determine an initial consistent point, to select a nonsingular set of basis variables (required for the definition of the search subspaces) and to identify linear dependency among the equality constraints. We demonstrate how Fourer's piecewise-linear simplex techniques allow us to solve a smaller initialization problem more efficiently than is possible with standard simplex techniques. Also, while the relative number of degrees of freedom in a process optimization problem is generally small, the actual number may become large. In this context, we present a new QP solver, QPKWIK, based on the dual algorithm of Goldfarb and Idnani. A unique feature of this algorithm is that it only requires the inverse Cholesky factor of the Hessian matrix to be supplied. At each iteration, this inverse Cholesky factor is obtained directly using a factorized inverse BFGS formula. The resulting solution technique for the QP subproblem is O(n2) with respect to the degrees of freedom of the problem, as opposed to most existing software which involves O(n3) operations. Further, the unconstrained optimum is dual feasible, which precludes the need for phase I calculations, and makes this method superior even for problems with few degrees of freedom. QPKWIK has been implemented so as to enhance the efficiency of the active set identification and is also able to determine a search direction when infeasible QP subproblems are encountered by relaxing the equality constraints without violating the simple bounds on the variables. Finally, numerical results are included, both to illustrate the advantages of the proposed techniques and to assess the overall performance of the reduced Hessian method. We note that this approach is especially well-suited for process and real-time optimization and demonstrate this on several distillation problems as well as the Sunoco Hydrocracker Fractionation problem. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Korda2018b,
abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to a numerical approximation of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so-called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple -- it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system of the same size. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. Numerical examples (including a high-dimensional nonlinear PDE control) demonstrate the approach with the source code available online.},

abstract = {In this paper the software environment and algorithm collection ACADO Toolkit is presented, which implements tools for automatic control and dynamic optimization. It provides a general framework for using a great variety of algorithms for direct optimal control, including model predictive control as well as state and parameter estimation. The ACADO Toolkit is implemented as a self-contained C++ code, while the object-oriented design allows for convenient coupling of existing optimization packages and for extending it with user-written optimization routines. We discuss details of the software design of the ACADO Toolkit 1.0 and describe its main software modules. Along with that we highlight a couple of algorithmic features, in particular its functionality to handle symbolic expressions. The user-friendly syntax of the ACADO Toolkit to set up optimization problems is illustrated with two tutorial examples: an optimal control and a parameter estimation problem.
