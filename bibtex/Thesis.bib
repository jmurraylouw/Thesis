@article{Proctor2016c,
abstract = {We develop a new method which extends dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to incorporate the effect of control to extract low-order models from high-dimensional, complex systems. DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations-only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

abstract = {The Koopman operator theory is an increasingly popular formalism of dynamical systems theory which enables analysis and prediction of the state space dynamics from measurement data. Building on the recent development of the Koopman model predictive control framework [14], we propose a methodology for closed-loop feedback control of nonlinear partial differential equations in a fully data-driven and model-free manner. In the first step, we compute a Koopman-linear representation of the system using a variation of the extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm and then we apply the model predictive control to the constructed linear model. Our methodology is also capable of utilizing sparse measurements by incorporating delay-embedding of the available data into the identification and control processes. We illustrate the application of this methodology for the periodic Burgers' equation and the boundary control of fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional cavity.},

@article{Garcia1989,
abstract = {We refer to Model Predictive Control (MPC) as that family of controllers in which there is a direct use of an explicit and separately identifiable model. Control design methods based on the MPC concept have found wide acceptance in industrial applications and have been studied by academia. The reason for such popularity is the ability of MPC designs to yield high performance control systems capable of operating without expert intervention for long periods of time. In this paper the issues of importance that any control system should address are stated. MPC techniques are then reviewed in the light of these issues in order to point out their advantages in design and implementation. A number of design techniques emanating from MPC, namely Dynamic Matrix Control, Model Algorithmic Control, Inferential Control and Internal Model Control, are put in perspective with respect to each other and the relation to more traditional methods like Linear Quadratic Control is examined. The flexible constraint handling capabilities of MPC are shown to be a significant advantage in the context of the overall operating objectives of the process industries and the 1-, 2-, and ∞-norm formulations of the performance objective are discussed. The application of MPC to non-linear systems is examined and it is shown that its main attractions carry over. Finally, it is explained that though MPC is not inherently more or less robust than classical feedback, it can be adjusted more easily for robustness. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Many systems of interest are exceedingly high dimensional, making them difficult to characterize. High dimensionality also limits controller robustness due to significant computational time delays. For example, for the governing equations of fluid dynamics, the resulting discretized equations may have millions or billions of degrees of freedom, making them expensive to simulate. Thus, significant effort has gone into obtaining reduced-order models that capture the most relevant mechanisms and are suitable for feedback control. Unlike reduced-order models based on proper orthogonal decomposition (see Chapters 11 and 12), which order modes based on energy content in the data, here we will discuss a class of balanced reduced-order models that employ a different inner product to order modes based on input-output energy. Thus, only modes that are both highly controllable and highly observable are selected, making balanced models ideal for control applications. In this chapter we also describe related procedures for model reduction and system identification , depending on whether or not the user starts with a high-fidelity model or simply has access to measurement data. 9.1 Model Reduction and System Identification In many nonlinear systems, it is still possible to use linear control techniques. For example, in fluid dynamics there are numerous success stories of linear model-based flow control [27, 180, 94], for example to delay transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a spatially developing boundary layer, to reduce skin-friction drag in wall turbulence, and to stabilize the flow past an open cavity. However, many linear control approaches do not scale well to large state spaces, and they may be prohibitively expensive to enact for real-time control on short timescales. Thus, it is often necessary to develop low-dimensional approximations of the system for use in real-time feedback control. There are two broad approaches to obtain reduced-order models (ROMs): First, it is possible to start with a high-dimensional system, such as the discretized Navier-Stokes equations, and project the dynamics onto a low-dimensional subspace identified, for example , using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD; Chapter 11) [57, 251] and Galerkin projection [441, 53]. There are numerous variations to this procedure, including the discrete empirical interpolation methods (DEIM; Section 12.5) [127, 419], gappy POD (Sec-tion 12.1) [179], balanced proper orthogonal decomposition (BPOD; Section 9.2) [554, 458], and many more. The second approach is to collect data from a simulation or an experiment and identify a low-rank model using data-driven techniques. This approach is typically called system identification, and is often preferred for control design because of the relative ease of implementation. Examples include the dynamic mode decomposition 321},

abstract = {Takens' Embedding Theorem asserts that when the states of a hidden dynamical system are confined to a low-dimensional attractor, complete information about the states can be preserved in the observed time-series output through the delay coordinate map. However, the conditions for the theorem to hold ignore the effects of noise and time-series analysis in practice requires a careful empirical determination of the sampling time and number of delays resulting in a number of delay coordinates larger than the minimum prescribed by Takens' theorem. In this paper, we use tools and ideas in Compressed Sensing to provide a first theoretical justification for the choice of the number of delays in noisy conditions. In particular, we show that under certain conditions on the dynamical system, linear measurement function, number of delays and sampling time, the delay-coordinate map can be a stable embedding of the dynamical systems attractor.},

abstract = {Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational effciency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

The use of error criteria in parameter estimation will be discussed, where the identified model is used in model predictive control (MPC). Assume that the model error is dominated by the variance part, it can be shown that a k-step-ahead prediction error model is not optimal for k-step-ahead prediction. A normal one-step-ahead prediction error criterion will be optimal for k-step-ahead prediction. Then it is argued that even when some bias exists, the result could still hold true. Therefore, for MPC identification of linear processes, one-step-ahead prediction error models fever k-step-ahead prediction models.

abstract = {We present a novel, deeply embedded robotics middleware and programming environment. It uses a multithreaded, publish-subscribe design pattern and provides a Unix-like software interface for micro controller applications. We improve over the state of the art in deeply embedded open source systems by providing a modular and standards-oriented platform. Our system architecture is centered around a publish-subscribe object request broker on top of a POSIX application programming interface. This allows to reuse common Unix knowledge and experience, including a bash-like shell. We demonstrate with a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) use case that the system modularity is well suited for novel and experimental vehicle platforms. We also show how the system architecture allows a direct interface to ROS and to run individual processes either as native ROS nodes on Linux or nodes on the micro controller, maximizing interoperability. Our microcontroller-based execution environment has substantially lower latency and better hardware connectivity than a typical Robotics Linux system and is therefore well suited for fast, high rate control tasks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a feedforward swing reducing control system for augmenting already existing helicopter controllers and enables slung load flight with autonomous helicopters for general cargo transport. The feedforward controller is designed to avoid excitation of the lightly damped modes of the system by shaping the reference trajectory using robust input shaping. It is developed together with a slung load state estimator capable of estimating the slung load swing frequency. This means that the control system can adapt to an unknown wire length for the slung load. Simulations and flight tests show the effectiveness of the input shaping applied to a small scale autonomous helicopter slung load system. Both simulations and flight verifications shows significant slung load swing reduction using the proposed trajectory shaping over flight without. Indeed it is shown how the system is capable of performing almost completely swing free maneuvers using the designed input shaper. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

abstract = {Understanding the interplay of order and disorder in chaos is a central challenge in modern quantitative science. Approximate linear representations of nonlinear dynamics have long been sought, driving considerable interest in Koopman theory. We present a universal, data-driven decomposition of chaos as an intermittently forced linear system. This work combines delay embedding and Koopman theory to decompose chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low-energy delay coordinates; this is called the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the Lorenz system and real-world examples including Earth's magnetic field reversal and measles outbreaks. In each case, forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare intermittent forcing that precedes switching and bursting phenomena. The forcing activity demarcates coherent phase space regions where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are s rongly nonlinear.},

abstract = {A novel data-driven modal decomposition of fluid flow is proposed, comprising key features of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The first mode is the normalized real or imaginary part of the DMD mode that minimizes the time-averaged residual. The th mode is defined recursively in an analogous manner based on the residual of an expansion using the first modes. The resulting recursive DMD (RDMD) modes are orthogonal by construction, retain pure frequency content and aim at low residual. Recursive DMD is applied to transient cylinder wake data and is benchmarked against POD and optimized DMD (Chen et al., J. Nonlinear Sci., vol. 22, 2012, pp. 887-915) for the same snapshot sequence. Unlike POD modes, RDMD structures are shown to have purer frequency content while retaining a residual of comparable order to POD. In contrast to DMD, with exponentially growing or decaying oscillatory amplitudes, RDMD clearly identifies initial, maximum and final fluctuation levels. Intriguingly, RDMD outperforms both POD and DMD in the limit-cycle resolution from the same snapshots. Robustness of these observations is demonstrated for other parameters of the cylinder wake and for a more complex wake behind three rotating cylinders. Recursive DMD is proposed as an attractive alternative to POD and DMD for empirical Galerkin models, in particular for nonlinear transient dynamics.},

abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon: in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

successfully in a wide range of fields, including fluid mechanics, robotics,

noise sensitivity and issues related to Krylov space closure when modeling
nonlinear systems. Here, we investigate the combination of noise and
nonlinearity in a controlled setting, by studying a class of systems with
linear latent dynamics which are observed via multinomial observables. Our
numerical models include system and measurement noise. We explore the
influences of dataset metrics, the spectrum of the latent dynamics, the
normality of the system matrix, and the geometry of the dynamics. Our results
show that even for these very mildly nonlinear conditions, DMD methods often
fail to recover the spectrum and can have poor predictive ability. Our work is
motivated by our experience modeling multilegged robot data, where we have
encountered great difficulty in reconstructing time series for oscillatory
systems with slow transients, which decay only slightly faster than a period.},

abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to a numerical approximation of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so-called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple -- it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system of the same size. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. Numerical examples (including a high-dimensional nonlinear PDE control) demonstrate the approach with the source code available online.},

abstract = {We develop an algorithm for model selection which allows for the consideration of a combinatorially large number of candidate models governing a dynamical system. The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model selection which typically limits the number of candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support, weak support or no support category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical systems, including a susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered disease model, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.},

abstract = {Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges.},
