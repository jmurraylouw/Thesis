    \FloatBarrier\section{Methodology}
        
        \paragraph
        As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id}, the methodology to generate practical data for the parameter estimation techniques involves two different flight stages.
        Firstly, the quadrotor hovers with the suspended payload to gather hover thrust data to estimate the payload mass.
        Then the quadrotor is commanded with a position step setpoint 
        to stimulate the swinging payload system for cable length estimation.

        \paragraph
        For the data-driven techniques, the methodology used to generate training and testing data from practical flights
        also follows the same general procedure as specified for simulation data in Section~\ref{sec:sys_id_methodology}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Data logging starts when the quadrotor is armed
            \item Takeoff and hover with the qaudrotor
            \item Command velocity step setpoints
            \item Land the quadrotor
            \item Data logging stops when the quadrotor is disarmed
            \item Download data log from the quadrotor
            \item Split data into separate training and testing periods
            \item Build a model from the training data
            \item Calculate an error metric for the model from the testing data
        \end{enumerate}

            \label{fig:honeybee_with_payload}
        \end{figure}

        \paragraph
        Figure~\ref{fig:honeybee_with_payload} shows Honeybee in flight with a suspended payload.
        Numerous flights were performed with different 
        payload masses, 
        cable lengths, 
        wind conditions, 
        and even with a more complex elongated payload.
        The system identification methods were then performed on the data resulting from this range of different use cases.
        The major differences between the simulations and practical flights involve the attachment of the payload and wind disturbances.
        In simulation, the payload cable is attached to the exact CoM of the quadrotor.
        However, due to practical constraints, the cable is attached slightly below the CoM of Honeybee.
        Practical flights are also influenced by wind disturbances, therefore this effect is also investigated in the sections below.
        In this chapter, wind conditions are referenced by the wind speed recorded by the website, www.yr.no, 
        for the hour of day of the flight.

        % In Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id} it was noted that the optimal length of training data 
        % often only included 2 velocity steps responses.
        % This means the models were trained on a very small sample of step sizes 
        % and need to extrapolate the dynamics of other step sizes.
        
    \FloatBarrier\section{Parameter estimation with practical data}
        
        \subsection{Mass estimation}

        As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id}, for this method to work, the mass of the quadrotor needs to be known.
        If a heavier battery or an extra accessory is added to the vehicle, 
        the new vehicle mass will first have to be estimated in a separate flight, before the payload can be attached.
        This is one of the disadvantages of the white-box modelling with parameter estimation based techniques.
        The method is designed with a specific system in mind 
        and needs to be adjusted and redesigned for every deviation from the the pre-assumed configuration.
        In contrast, the data-driven technique is a general solution which works for a much wider range of system configurations.
        The data-driven technique is not readjusted for an added vehicle mass, 
        since the whole model is estimated instead of specific parameters.

    \FloatBarrier\section{Data-driven system identification with practical data}

        \paragraph
        It was shown that the simulation environment 
        In Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id} it was shown that the data-driven methods 
        build accurate state prediction models for the considered system.
        It was also shown in Chapter~\ref{chap:modelling} that the simulation environment is a realistic representation of the practical system.
        However, there are still differences between simulations and practical flight.
        Therefore the data-driven algorithms are applied to practical flight data in this chapter 
        to investigate their performance in a practical implementation.

        \FloatBarrier\subsection{Length of training data}

            \paragraph
            As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sys_id_length_of_data}, 
            the length of training data used in the model has a large effect on prediction accuracy.
            The length of training data required for accurate models is largely influenced by the amount of wind disturbance during flight.
            Figure~\ref{fig:wind_Ttrain} shows prediction error as a function of training data length for different wind conditions.
            Its clear that the prediction error decreases with increasing wind speeds.
            It appears that for wind speeds lower than \SI{2}{\metre/\second}, 
            the minimum prediction error is not significantly improved with decreasing wind speeds.
            This may be because the flight dynamics is not significantly affected at such low wind speeds.
            
            \paragraph
            Wind adds an unmeasured input, also referred to as process noise, to the plant and this is not accounted for in the model.
            As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:noise}, the constant offset is subtracted from the acceleration setpoint data, 
            which results in a signal with a zero mean.
            This accounts for the constant component in the acceleration setpoint signal required to counteract the mean force of the wind.
            However, the wind speed deviates randomly from the mean speed which results in random process noise in the plant.

            % \paragraph
            % It appears that for higher wind speeds, 
            % the prediction error does not reach a peak value within the considered range of training data lengths.
            
            % This is expected, since the algorithms require longer lengths of training data to

            HAVOK and DMD perform similarly
            Figure~\ref{fig:havok_vs_dmd_Ttrain_2mps} shows the prediction error of DMD and HAVOK models

        \FloatBarrier\subsection{Hyperparameters}
            
            \paragraph
            As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:hyperparameters}, 
            the prediction error generally improves with an increasing number of delay-coordinates 
            because the number of parameters in the model increases.
            However, the prediction error reaches a pareto optimum, 
            after which the error does not significantly decrease with an increasing number of terms anymore.
            Figure~\ref{fig:havok_vs_dmd_q_2mps} shows the prediction error as a function of the number of delay-coordinates
            for practical flight data.
            Even though the pareto elbow is not as smooth and clear as models build from simulation data, 
            the elbow can still be identified.            
            % Note that the pareto elbow is not as smooth and clear as shown in Section~\ref{sec:hyperparameters}.
            % This may due to random

            \paragraph
            It was shown with multiple simulations in Section~\ref{sec:system_params} 
            that the system identification methods work for a range of different payload parameters.
            Figure~\ref{fig:prac_system_params} shows the prediction error for different payloads with practical data.
            This shows that the proposed methods also work in practice with different payloads.
            The `double-descent' trend is clearly seen in all of the plots, 
            where the prediction error increases slightly after a specific length of training data,

        \FloatBarrier\subsection{Dynamic payload} 

            \paragraph
            As mentioned in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id}, 
            one of the disadvantages of the white-box system identification approach
            is that it relies heavily on a priori modeling assumptions.
            When a payload is attached that deviates from the white-box modelling assumptions, 
            the performance of the system identification method decreases.
            However, the performance of the data-driven methods can handle this deviation
            because it does not rely on these assumptions.

            \paragraph
            One of the main assumptions of the white-box model considered in Section~\ref{sec:param_estimation},
            is that the suspended payload is a point mass.
            This reduced the considered suspended payload system to a simple pendulum.
            Figure~\ref{fig:practical_double_pendulum} shows a practical dynamic payload 
            which deviates significantly from this assumption.
            It shows a photo of an elongated payload 
            suspended from Honeybee during a practical flight.
            The mass distribution causes a relative rotation of the payload with respect to the suspended cable,
            which significantly affects the flight dynamics.

            Vel prediction.
            Note that the prediction is propagated from an initial condition and the given input data only.
            The model does not use state measurements to readjust after the initial condition is taken.
            Because the model prediction matches the practical testing data so closely,
            it is expected that this model can effectively be used for a practical MPC implementation. 

            % As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:control_systems}, 
            % this prediction model can be used in an MPC to optimise the control input to actively damp the payload swing angles.

    \FloatBarrier\section{Swing damping control systems}

        \paragraph
        After the system identification phase, active swing damping control can be applied
        to the quadrotor and payload system.
        The control architectures are summarised in Table~\ref{tbl:controller_summary} 
        by pairing the system identification techniques along with the appropriate controllers.
        It was firstly shown in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id} that the system identifcation techniques worked in simulation.
        Emphasise that control is now applied in full SITL simulation.

        \paragraph
        MATLAB is used to generate a MPC ROS node 
        This ROS node receives state feedback from the Gazebo simulator,
        computes the optimal control action,
        and send the setpoint to PX4 through the package 'mavros'.
