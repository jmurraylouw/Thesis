    \section{System identification with practical data}

        \subsection{Methodology}
            Method for generating data
            picture of practical flight single and double
            Discuss difference between SITL and prac
                Noise 
                wind
                CoM
            plot hover of prac vs SITL vel-sp.z = 0

        \subsection{Length of training data}
            plot NMAE vs Ttrain
            Difference between SITl and practical (same input steps)
            This is due to wind disturbance
            Plot wind vs less wind vs no wind

            single pend vs double pend

        \subsection{Hyperparameters}
            plot NMAE vs q
            Difference between SITl and practical (same input steps)
            This is due to wind disturbance
            Plot wind vs less wind vs no wind
            
        \subsection{System parameters}
            Show that practical data also works for different system parameters
            plot NMAE vs Ttrain

        \subsection{Extended dimensions}
            plot error vs T-train for  XY
            plot error vs T-train for  XYZ

        \subsection{Predictions}
            Single pendulum
            Plot 4 showing good and bad

            Double pendulum
            Plot 4 showing good and bad
