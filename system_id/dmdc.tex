\section{Dynamic mode decomposition with control}
\label{sec:dmdc}
    
    \paragraph        
    DMD is a regression technique that can be used to approximate a non-linear dynamical system with a linear model \cite{Tu2014}.
    It uses temporal measurements of system outputs to reconstruct system dynamics without prior modelling assumptions.
    DMDc is an adaptation of DMD that also accounts for control inputs \cite{Proctor2016c}.
    This section provides an overview of the specific implementation of DMDc used in this work.        
    Note that this implementation is an adaptation of DMDc, and includes time-delay-embedding of multiple observables. 
    Enriching a DMD model with time-delay-embedding is a known technique and is also seen in other DMD adaptations \cite{Korda2018b, Arbabi2018}.

    \paragraph
    DMD produces a linear, discrete state-space model of system dynamics.
    Discrete measurements, $\bm{x}_k$, of the continuous time observable, $\bm{x}(t)$, are used, 
    where $\bm{x}_k = \bm{x}(k T_s)$, and $T_s$ is the sampling time of the model.    
    Delay-coordinates (i.e. $\bm{x}_{k-1}, \bm{x}_{k-2}$, etc.) are also included in the state-space model to
    account for input delay and state delay in the system.
    Input delay refers to the time delay involved with transporting a control signal to a system, 
    whereas state delay refers to time-separated interactions between system variables \cite{Chen1999}.
    Hence, we define an state delay vector as:
    \begin{equation}
        \bm{d}_{k} = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \bm{x}_{k-1} & \bm{x}_{k-2} & \cdots & \bm{x}_{k-q+1}
        \end{bmatrix}^T ,
    \end{equation}
    $\bm{d}_k \in \R^{(n_x)(q-1)}$ and where $q$ is the number of delay-coordinates 
    (including the current time-step) used in the model.
    
    \paragraph
    The discrete state-space model is therefore defined as:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:dmd_state_space}
        \bm{x}_{k+1} = \bm{A} \bm{x}_k + \bm{A}_d \bm{d}_k + \bm{B} \bm{u}_k ,
    \end{equation}
    \( \bm{A} \in \R^{n_x \times n_x} \) is the system matrix, 
    \( \bm{A}_1 \in \R^{(q-1) \cdot n_x ~ \times ~ (q-1) \cdot n_x} \) is the state delay system matrix and 
    \( \bm{B} \in \R^{n_x \times n_u} \) is the input matrix.
    
    \paragraph
    The training data consists of full-state measurements, $\bm{x}_k$, and corresponding inputs, $\bm{u}_k$, 
    taken at regular intervals of $\Delta t = T_s$, during a simulated flight with Cascaded PID control.
    In a practical flight, these time-series measurements need to be saved in memory because it is usd as a single batch by DMD.
    Note that DMD can be applied in a recursive manner as described in \cite{Noack2016}, 
    However this implementation is not considered because memory size will not be a limitation since a companion computer will be used.
    
    \paragraph
    The training data is collected into the following matrices:
    \begin{align} \label{eq:dmd_matrices}
        \bm{X^\prime} = & \phantom{.} \left [
            \begin{array}{*{5}{@{}M{\mycolwd}@{}}}
                    \bm{x}_{q+1} & \bm{x}_{q+2} & \bm{x}_{q+3} & \cdots & \bm{x}_{w+q}
            \end{array}
        \right ] , \nonumber \\
        %
        \bm{X} \phantom{''} = & \phantom{.} \left [
            \begin{array}{*{5}{@{}M{\mycolwd}@{}}}
                \bm{x}_{q} & \bm{x}_{q+1} & \bm{x}_{q+2} & \cdots & \bm{x}_{w+q-1}                      
            \end{array}
        \right ] , \nonumber \\
        % 
        \bm{X}_d \phantom{'} = & \phantom{'} \left [
            \begin{array}{*{5}{@{}M{\mycolwd}@{}}}
                \bm{x}_{q-1} & \bm{x}_{q+0} & \bm{x}_{q+1} & \cdots & \bm{x}_{w+q-2} \\
                \vdots   & \vdots   & \vdots   & \ddots & \vdots \\
                \bm{x}_2 & \bm{x}_3 & \bm{x}_4 & \cdots & \bm{x}_{w+1} \\
                \bm{x}_1 & \bm{x}_2 & \bm{x}_3 & \cdots & \bm{x}_{w} \\                       
            \end{array}
        \right ] , \nonumber \\
        % 
        \bm{\Upsilon} \phantom{'} = & \phantom{.} \left [
            \begin{array}{*{5}{@{}M{\mycolwd}@{}}}
                    \bm{u}_{q} & \bm{u}_{q+1} & \bm{u}_{q+2} & \cdots & \bm{u}_{w+q-1}
            \end{array}
        \right ] ,
    \end{align}
    where $w$ is the number of columns in the matrices, 
    $\bm{X^\prime}$ is the matrix $\bm{X}$ shifted forward by one time-step, 
    $\bm{X}_d$ is the matrix with delay states, 
    and $\bm{\Upsilon}$ is the matrix of inputs.
    Equation (\ref{eq:dmd_state_space}) can be combined with the matrices in Equation (\ref{eq:dmd_matrices}) to produce:
    \begin{equation}
        \bm{X^\prime} = \bm{A} \bm{X} + \bm{A}_d \bm{X}_d + \bm{B} \bm{\Upsilon} .
    \end{equation}
    Note that the primary objective of DMDc is to determine the best fit model matrices, $\bm{A}$, $\bm{A}_d$ and $\bm{B}$, 
    given the data in $\bm{X^\prime}$, $\bm{X}$, $\bm{X}_d$, and $\bm{\Upsilon}$ \cite{Proctor2016c}.
    In order to group the unknowns into a single matrix, (\ref{eq:dmd_state_space}) is manipulated into the form,
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:G_Omega}
        \bm{X^\prime} =   
        \begin{bmatrix} 
            \bm{A} & \bm{A}_d & \bm{B} 
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix} 
            \bm{X} \\ \bm{X}_d \\ \bm{\Upsilon} 
        \end{bmatrix} 
        = \bm{G \Omega} ,
    \end{equation} 
    where $\bm{\Omega}$ contains the state and control data, and $\bm{G}$ represents the system and input matrices.
    
    \paragraph
    A SVD is performed on $\bm{\Omega}$ resulting in:
    \(
        \bm{\Omega} = \bm{U} \bm{\Sigma} \bm{V}^T
    \).
    Often, only the first $p$ columns of $\bm{U}$ and $\bm{V}$ are required for a good approximation of the dynamics \cite{Brunton2017a}.
    % Talk about Reduced Order Modelling??
    % POD modes??
    In many cases, the truncated form results in better models than the exact form when noisy measurements are used.
    This is because the effect of measurement noise is mostly captured by the truncated columns of $\bm{U}$ and $\bm{V}$.
    By truncating these columns, the influence of noise in the regression problem is reduced. 
    % \murray{explain this better ??}
    Hence the SVD is used in the truncated form: 
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:tilde_svd}
        \bm{\Omega} \approx \Tilde{\bm{U}} \Tilde{\bm{\Sigma}} \Tilde{\bm{V}}^T ,
    \end{equation}
    where $\phantom{.} \Tilde{ } \phantom{.}$ represents rank-$p$ truncation.
    % \murray{maybe insert colour pictures showing matrices ??}        

    \paragraph
    By combining (\ref{eq:tilde_svd}) with the over-constrained equality in (\ref{eq:G_Omega}), 
    the least-squared solution, $\bm{G}$, can be found with:
    \begin{equation}
        \bm{G} \approx \bm{X^\prime} \Tilde{\bm{V}} \Tilde{\bm{\Sigma}}^{-1} \Tilde{\bm{U}} .
    \end{equation}
    By reversing \ref{eq:G_Omega}, $\bm{G}$ can now be separated into:
    \(
        \bm{G} = \begin{bmatrix} \bm{A} & \bm{A}_d & \bm{B} \end{bmatrix}.
    \)
    according to the required dimensions of each matrix.
    Thereby, the state-space model approximated by DMDc is complete.
