\chapter{System identification}
\label{chap:system_id}

    \paragraph{}
    System identification is the process of creating mathematical models of a dynamical system by using input and output measurements of that system.
    Two major approaches are used to represent the dynamics of such a system:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A priori mathematical modelling with parameter estimation
        \item Data-driven system identification
    \end{enumerate}

    Models determined from a priori modelling and parameter estimation are referred to as white-box models.
    In contrast, data-driven system identification methods result in black-box models.
    This chapter discusses these system identification approaches and describes the differences between them.
    For each approach, different estimation techniques are explained and applied to the quadrotor and payload system.
    The results of these techniques are then compared to each other.

    \section{Conclusion}
    DMD and HAVOK work very similarly with single pend.
    HAVOK has slightly better prediction accuracy, but this small difference has neglible effect on control.
    It is difficult to compare the white-box to the black-box models because the real effect will only be seen during control.
    However it is clear that the accuracy of the white-box model degrades significantly 
    when a payload that causes double pendulum dynamics.

    The major advantage of the data-driven approach which was demonstrated in this section 
    is that the method was applied to different dynamical systems   

    \paragraph{}
    For each of these payload cases, a different parameter estimation based techniques would needs to be designed for effective control.
    This is undesirable for practical drone deliveries, especially when the type of paylaod is not known well in advance or changes regularly.
    A data-driven technique provides a more general solution since it accommodates a larger range of payload types and does not require a prioir modelling information.
        
    \paragraph{}
    Since the a priori white-box model is based on a single pendulum model, 
    the dynamics described by the model are significantly different from the actual dynamics.
    This will have a detrimental effect on the control performance of a controller based on such a model,
    since the controller will be designed for different plant than what it is controlling actually controlling.
