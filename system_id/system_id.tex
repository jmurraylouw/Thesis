\chapter{System identification}
\label{chap:system_id}

    \paragraph{}
    System identification is the process of creating mathematical models of a dynamical system by using input and output measurements of that system.
    Two major approaches are used to represent the dynamics of such a system:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A priori mathematical modelling with parameter estimation
        \item Data-driven system identification
    \end{enumerate}

    Models determined from a priori modelling and parameter estimation are referred to as white-box models.
    In contrast, data-driven system identification methods result in black-box models.
    This chapter discusses these system identification approaches and describes the differences between them.
    For each approach, different estimation techniques are explained and applied to the quadrotor and payload system.
    The results of these techniques are then compared to each other.

    \section{Conclusion}
    DMD and HAVOK work very similarly with single pend.
    HAVOK has slightly better prediction accuracy, but this small difference has neglible effect on control.
    It is difficult to compare the white-box to the black-box models because the real effect will only be seen during control.
    However it is clear that the accuracy of the white-box model degrades significantly 
    when a payload that causes double pendulum dynamics.
