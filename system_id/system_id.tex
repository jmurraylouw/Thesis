\chapter{System identification}
\label{chap:system_id}

    \paragraph
    System identification is the process of creating a mathematical model of a dynamic system 
    by using input and output measurements of that system.
    In this work, a mathematical model of the multirotor and suspended payload system is required for use in a swing damping controller.
    The two major approaches to system identification are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parameter estimation with a~priori modelling
        \item Data-driven system identification
    \end{enumerate}

    \paragraph
    This chapter will discuss these approaches and describe the differences between them.
    For each approach, specific estimation techniques will be applied to simulation data of the multirotor-payload system.
    The results of these techniques will then be discussed.

    \FloatBarrier\section{Summary}

        \paragraph
        \gls{DMDc} and \gls{HAVOKc} produce very similar prediction errors for a range of different simulation conditions.
        \gls{HAVOKc} generally has slightly lower errors, but this may have a negligible effect on a controller which is based on such a model.
        \gls{DMDc} is selected as the preferred method because it has a lower computationally complexity.
        
        \paragraph
        The data-driven methods were shown to produce accurate prediction models of the multirotor-payload dynamics 
        with sample times and lengths of training data that appear to be practically feasible for a control architecture.
        The methods also produced accurate models despite a realistic level of sensor noise.
        
        \paragraph
        Furthermore, the data-driven methods were tested with a range of different payload parameters
        and with an elongated dynamic payload acting as a double pendulum.
        The methods produced consistently accurate models with these different payloads.
        The white-box system identification technique produced accurate models with different payload parameters but failed to represent the motion of the dynamic payload.
        Therefore, the data-driven approach provides a better general system identification method 
        that can be used for a range of different payloads without being redesigned for specific dynamics.

        % \gls{DMDc} and \gls{HAVOKc} work very similarly with single pend.
        % \gls{HAVOKc} has slightly better prediction accuracy, but this small difference has negligible effect on control.
        % It is difficult to compare the white-box to the black-box models because the real effect will only be seen during control.
        % However, it is clear that the accuracy of the white-box model degrades significantly 
        % when a payload that causes double pendulum dynamics.

        % The major advantage of the data-driven approach which was demonstrated in this section 
        % is that the method was applied to different dynamical systems   

        % \paragraph
        % For each of these payload cases, a different parameter estimation based techniques would needs to be designed for effective control.
        % This is undesirable for practical drone deliveries, especially when the type of payload is not known well in advance or changes regularly.
        % A data-driven technique provides a more general solution since it accommodates a larger range of payload types and does not require a~priori modelling information.
            
        % \paragraph
        % Since the a~priori white-box model is based on a single pendulum model, 
        % the dynamics described by the model are significantly different from the actual dynamics.
        % This will have a detrimental effect on the control performance of a controller based on such a model,
        % since the controller will be designed for different plant than what it is controlling actually controlling.
