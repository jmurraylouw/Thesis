\section{Parameter estimation} \label{sec:param_estimation}

    \paragraph
    Parameter estimation algorithms determine the unknown values required by the predetermined, white-box model.
    This model is used to design a \gls{LQR} controller and therefore needs to be a linear, continuous-time, state-space model.
    The white-box model was derived by \cite{Slabber2020} and will be presented in the section below.
    The unknown parameters in the model include the payload mass, $m_p$ and the cable length, $l$.
    Two separate methods are used to estimate each parameter.
    This approach was successfully used by \cite{Slabber2020} and \cite{Erasmus2020} 
    to implement a \gls{LQR} swing damping controller for a multirotor with unknown suspended payload parameters.
    
\subsection{White-box model}

    \paragraph
    A white-box model was derived a~priori by \cite{Slabber2020} to represent the dynamics of the multirotor-payload system.
    The non-linear dynamical equations derived in Chapter~\ref{chap:modelling} were linearised to produce a linear state-space model.
    The equations were linearised around hover by applying small angle approximations.
    As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:payload_assumptions}, the payload is attached to the \gls{CoM} of the multirotor.
    Therefore the vehicle attitude dynamics are decoupled from the payload dynamics and are not considered in this model.
    Aerodynamic drag forces are assumed to be negligible and are ignored in this model.
    It is also assumed that the attitude controllers have a large enough time-scale separation from the velocity controllers, such that $A_{N_{sp}} \approx A_N$.
    
    % \paragraph
    % In the work \cite{Slabber2020}, it was assumed that aerodynamic drag forces are negligible and can be ignored.
    % In this work however, a simplified linear damping model is used to account for aerodynamic drag forces.
    % The aerodynamic drag force in the North axis is approximated by, 
    % \begin{equation}
    %     F_N^A = - c_{air} V_N
    % \end{equation}
    
    \paragraph
    The resultant linear state-space model of the longitudinal dynamics is given by,
    \begin{equation}
        \dot{\bm{x}}_{long} = \bm{A}_{long} \bm{x}_{long} + \bm{B}_{long} \bm{u}_{long} ,
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{align}
        \bm{x}_{long} &= 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                V_N & \theta & \dot{\theta}
            \end{bmatrix}^T, \\
        \bm{u}_{long} &= 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                A_{N_{sp}}
            \end{bmatrix}, \\
        \bm{A}_{long} &= 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                0 & \frac{ m_p \cdot g}{m_Q} & \frac{c}{(l\cdot m_Q)} \\
                0 & 0 & 1 \\
                0 & \frac{ (m_p+m_Q) \cdot g}{(m_Q \cdot l) } & \frac{ -c \cdot (m_p+m_Q)}{(l^2 \cdot m_Q \cdot m_p)}
            \end{bmatrix}, \mbox{ and} \\
        \bm{B}_{long} &= 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1\\
                0 \\
                - \frac{1}{l} \\
            \end{bmatrix} .
    \end{align}

    % matrix with linear air damping:
    % \bm{A}_{long} &= 
    % \begin{bmatrix}
    %     \frac{ -c_{air} }{m_Q} & \frac{ m_p \cdot g}{m_Q} & \frac{c}{(l\cdot m_Q)} \\
    %     0 & 0 & 1 \\
    %     \frac{ c_{air} }{ (m_Q \cdot l) } & \frac{ (m_p+m_Q) \cdot g}{(m_Q \cdot l) } & \frac{ -c \cdot (m_p+m_Q)}{(l^2 \cdot m_Q \cdot m_p)}
    % \end{bmatrix}, \mbox{ and} \\

    \paragraph
    It is assumed that the coefficient of friction, $c$, does not change for different payloads, therefore this parameter can be determined experimentally and is before a flight.
    Furthermore, it is assumed that $m_Q$ is known.
    The payload parameters, $m_p$ and $l$, are unknown before a flight. 
    These parameters will be estimated in the sections below.    

\subsection{Payload mass estimation}

    \paragraph
    \gls{RLS} is used by \cite{Slabber2020} and \cite{Erasmus2020} to estimate the payload mass.
    It is assumed that the multirotor mass is known before a flight, 
    therefore the payload mass can be estimated from the additional trust required during hover.
    In both \cite{Slabber2020} and \cite{Erasmus2020} it is demonstrated 
    that \gls{RLS} is very accurate for the system considered in this work.
    To compare other aspects of the white-box and black-box techniques with more clarity, 
    it will be assumed that the \gls{RLS} method estimates $m_p$ with perfect accuracy.
    This isolates any inaccuracies in the white-box model to a~priori modelling errors or cable length estimation errors.

    \paragraph
    Note that this method depends on the assumption that the vehicle mass is known and remains unchanged.
    The method will be inaccurate if an unknown mass is added to the multirotor.
    Common examples include adding a camera to the vehicle or using a different battery.
    In these cases, the mass estimation method will have to be redesigned.
    This is an inherent problem of the white-box technique.
    The technique is designed for specific modelling assumptions and is not adaptable to different types of payload loadings.
    In contrast, data-driven techniques are adaptable to different payload loadings 
    because it does not depend on a~priori modelling.

\subsection{Cable length estimation} \label{sec:length_estimation}

    \paragraph
    The cable length is estimated from the measurement of the natural frequency of the swinging payload.
    As described by \cite{Bisgaard2008}, the natural frequency is given by:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:nat_freq}
        \omega_n = \sqrt{ \frac{g}{l} \cdot \frac{m_Q + m_p}{m_Q}} .
    \end{equation}
    The cable length can be calculated from Equation~\ref{eq:nat_freq} if the other parameters are known.
    The natural frequency is measured by performing a \gls{FFT} on the payload swing angle response after a velocity step by the multirotor.
    The dominant frequency identified by the \gls{FFT} during free swing is an approximate measurement of the natural frequency of the payload.
    
    \paragraph
    Note that the measured frequency actually represents the damped natural frequency.
    Damping is caused by the velocity controller, friction at the cable attachment, and aerodynamic drag.
    However, it is assumed that the damping coefficient is small enough for the damped natural frequency to closely approximate the theoretical natural frequency.
    % This method is applied successfully by \cite{Slabber2020} and \cite{Erasmus2020} for cable length estimation.
    
    \paragraph
    Figure~\ref{fig:vel_step_single_pend} shows the payload swing angle response to a position step setpoint.
    The first few seconds of the step response are excluded from the \gls{FFT} 
    to minimise the effects of the transient response and multirotor controllers on the natural frequency measurement.
    Figure~\ref{fig:FFT_vel_step} shows the resulting single-sided amplitude spectrum of the \gls{FFT} of this data.
    
    \paragraph
    The dominant frequency is clearly identified by the peak at \SI{0.520}{\radian/\second}.
    Since $\omega_n$, $m_Q$, $m_p$ and $g$ are known, $l$ can be determined from Equation~\ref{eq:nat_freq}.
    The estimated length for this simulation is \SI{0.953}{\metre}.
    The actual cable length is \SI{1}{\metre}, therefore this estimation error is 4.7\%.
    As documented by \cite{Slabber2020} and \cite{Erasmus2020}, an error of this magnitude is acceptably small and still results in effective control with a \gls{LQR}.
    It was also shown by \cite{Slabber2020} and \cite{Erasmus2020} that this estimation method is effective for a range of different payloads in simulation.
