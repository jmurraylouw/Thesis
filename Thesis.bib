The discrete-time model is especially derived from the continuous-time system, that it has a wider range for the sampling period in real implementation. A simple method is also proposed to determine the unknown state-delay time from the available discrete-time model, and the continuous-time model is established through some important results demonstrated in this paper.},

abstract = {Understanding the interplay of order and disorder in chaos is a central challenge in modern quantitative science. Approximate linear representations of nonlinear dynamics have long been sought, driving considerable interest in Koopman theory. We present a universal, data-driven decomposition of chaos as an intermittently forced linear system. This work combines delay embedding and Koopman theory to decompose chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low-energy delay coordinates; this is called the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the Lorenz system and real-world examples including Earth's magnetic field reversal and measles outbreaks. In each case, forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare intermittent forcing that precedes switching and bursting phenomena. The forcing activity demarcates coherent phase space regions where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are s rongly nonlinear.},

To date, most simulators have been restricted to 2D worlds, and few have matured to the point where they are both highly capable and easily adaptable. Gazebo is designed to fill this niche by creating a 3D dynamic multi-robot environment capable of recreating the complex worlds that will be encountered by the next generation of mobile robots. Its open source status, fine grained control, and high fidelity place Gazebo in a unique position to become more than just a stepping stone between the drawing board and real hardware: data visualization, simulation of remote environments, and even reverse engineering of black-box systems are all possible applications.

abstract = {Many systems of interest are exceedingly high dimensional, making them difficult to characterize. High dimensionality also limits controller robustness due to significant computational time delays. For example, for the governing equations of fluid dynamics, the resulting discretized equations may have millions or billions of degrees of freedom, making them expensive to simulate. Thus, significant effort has gone into obtaining reduced-order models that capture the most relevant mechanisms and are suitable for feedback control. Unlike reduced-order models based on proper orthogonal decomposition (see Chapters 11 and 12), which order modes based on energy content in the data, here we will discuss a class of balanced reduced-order models that employ a different inner product to order modes based on input-output energy. Thus, only modes that are both highly controllable and highly observable are selected, making balanced models ideal for control applications. In this chapter we also describe related procedures for model reduction and system identification , depending on whether or not the user starts with a high-fidelity model or simply has access to measurement data. 9.1 Model Reduction and System Identification In many nonlinear systems, it is still possible to use linear control techniques. For example, in fluid dynamics there are numerous success stories of linear model-based flow control [27, 180, 94], for example to delay transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a spatially developing boundary layer, to reduce skin-friction drag in wall turbulence, and to stabilize the flow past an open cavity. However, many linear control approaches do not scale well to large state spaces, and they may be prohibitively expensive to enact for real-time control on short timescales. Thus, it is often necessary to develop low-dimensional approximations of the system for use in real-time feedback control. There are two broad approaches to obtain reduced-order models (ROMs): First, it is possible to start with a high-dimensional system, such as the discretized Navier-Stokes equations, and project the dynamics onto a low-dimensional subspace identified, for example , using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD; Chapter 11) [57, 251] and Galerkin projection [441, 53]. There are numerous variations to this procedure, including the discrete empirical interpolation methods (DEIM; Section 12.5) [127, 419], gappy POD (Sec-tion 12.1) [179], balanced proper orthogonal decomposition (BPOD; Section 9.2) [554, 458], and many more. The second approach is to collect data from a simulation or an experiment and identify a low-rank model using data-driven techniques. This approach is typically called system identification, and is often preferred for control design because of the relative ease of implementation. Examples include the dynamic mode decomposition 321},

@article{Korda2018b,
abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to a numerical approximation of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so-called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple -- it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system of the same size. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. Numerical examples (including a high-dimensional nonlinear PDE control) demonstrate the approach with the source code available online.},

abstract = {The Koopman operator theory is an increasingly popular formalism of dynamical systems theory which enables analysis and prediction of the state space dynamics from measurement data. Building on the recent development of the Koopman model predictive control framework [14], we propose a methodology for closed-loop feedback control of nonlinear partial differential equations in a fully data-driven and model-free manner. In the first step, we compute a Koopman-linear representation of the system using a variation of the extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm and then we apply the model predictive control to the constructed linear model. Our methodology is also capable of utilizing sparse measurements by incorporating delay-embedding of the available data into the identification and control processes. We illustrate the application of this methodology for the periodic Burgers' equation and the boundary control of fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional cavity.},

@article{Noack2016,
abstract = {A novel data-driven modal decomposition of fluid flow is proposed, comprising key features of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The first mode is the normalized real or imaginary part of the DMD mode that minimizes the time-averaged residual. The th mode is defined recursively in an analogous manner based on the residual of an expansion using the first modes. The resulting recursive DMD (RDMD) modes are orthogonal by construction, retain pure frequency content and aim at low residual. Recursive DMD is applied to transient cylinder wake data and is benchmarked against POD and optimized DMD (Chen et al., J. Nonlinear Sci., vol. 22, 2012, pp. 887-915) for the same snapshot sequence. Unlike POD modes, RDMD structures are shown to have purer frequency content while retaining a residual of comparable order to POD. In contrast to DMD, with exponentially growing or decaying oscillatory amplitudes, RDMD clearly identifies initial, maximum and final fluctuation levels. Intriguingly, RDMD outperforms both POD and DMD in the limit-cycle resolution from the same snapshots. Robustness of these observations is demonstrated for other parameters of the cylinder wake and for a more complex wake behind three rotating cylinders. Recursive DMD is proposed as an attractive alternative to POD and DMD for empirical Galerkin models, in particular for nonlinear transient dynamics.},

@article{Kaiser2018b,
abstract = {Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges.},

abstract = {We develop an algorithm for model selection which allows for the consideration of a combinatorially large number of candidate models governing a dynamical system. The innovation circumvents a disadvantage of standard model selection which typically limits the number of candidate models considered due to the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows feasible computation of Akaike information criteria (AIC) or Bayes information criteria scores for the remaining candidate models. The information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support in relation to the time-series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores place each candidate model in the strong support, weak support or no support category. The method correctly recovers several canonical dynamical systems, including a susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered disease model, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz equations, identifying the correct dynamical system as the only candidate model with strong support.},

abstract = {Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational effciency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations-only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations.
