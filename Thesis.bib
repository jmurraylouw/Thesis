abstract = {A new approach to model conversion of a state-delay system is introduced in this paper. The discrete-time model is especially derived from the continuous-time system, that it has a wider range for the sampling period in real implementation. A simple method is also proposed to determine the unknown state-delay time from the available discrete-time model, and the continuous-time model is established through some important results demonstrated in this paper.},

@article{Korda2018b,
abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to a numerical approximation of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so-called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple -- it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system of the same size. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. Numerical examples (including a high-dimensional nonlinear PDE control) demonstrate the approach with the source code available online.},

@article{Tu2014,
abstract = {Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational effciency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

@article{Proctor2016c,
abstract = {We develop a new method which extends dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to incorporate the effect of control to extract low-order models from high-dimensional, complex systems. DMD finds spatial-temporal coherent modes, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and provides an equation-free architecture which is compatible with compressive sensing. In actuated systems, DMD is incapable of producing an input-output model; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new method, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), capitalizes on all of the advantages of DMD and provides the additional innovation of being able to disambiguate between the underlying dynamics and the effects of actuation, resulting in accurate input-output models. The method is data-driven in that it does not require knowledge of the underlying governing equations-only snapshots in time of observables and actuation data from historical, experimental, or black-box simulations. We demonstrate the method on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including a model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

@article{Arbabi2018,
abstract = {The Koopman operator theory is an increasingly popular formalism of dynamical systems theory which enables analysis and prediction of the state space dynamics from measurement data. Building on the recent development of the Koopman model predictive control framework [14], we propose a methodology for closed-loop feedback control of nonlinear partial differential equations in a fully data-driven and model-free manner. In the first step, we compute a Koopman-linear representation of the system using a variation of the extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm and then we apply the model predictive control to the constructed linear model. Our methodology is also capable of utilizing sparse measurements by incorporating delay-embedding of the available data into the identification and control processes. We illustrate the application of this methodology for the periodic Burgers' equation and the boundary control of fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional cavity.},
