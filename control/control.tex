\chapter{Control systems}
\label{chap:control}

    \paragraph
    Three different types of controllers are considered in this work, namely \gls{PID}, \gls{LQR}, and \gls{MPC}.
    \gls{PID} control does not provide active swing-damping control of the payload, but it is used in the training data stage discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id}. 
    \gls{LQR} is a popular and well-known optimal control technique. 
    In previous work by \cite{Erasmus2020} and \cite{Slabber2020}, 
    an \gls{LQR} implementation with a parameter estimator was designed for active swing-damping control of a multirotor with an unknown suspended payload.
    This \gls{LQR} architecture was shown to be an effective swing-damping controller and will be applied in this work as the baseline controller.
    
    \paragraph
    A data-driven system identification method was introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id} to estimate a linear model of unknown dynamics.
    The models generated by this method will be used in an \gls{MPC} for active swing-damping control of the multirotor and payload system. 
    The proposed \gls{MPC} architecture will be compared to the baseline \gls{LQR} controller.
    These swing-damping control architectures are summarised in Table~\ref{tbl:controller_summary}, where each controller is paired with a system identification method.

    % In this chapter, an overview of the different controllers will be given and the design process of each controller will be explained.
    % A Simulink\texttrademark~simulation environment will also be introduced to test these controllers.
    % The controllers will then be tested in simulations with different system parameters and disturbances.
    % Finally, the simulation results will be shown and discussed.
