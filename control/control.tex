\chapter{Control systems}
\label{chap:control}

    \paragraph
    Three different types of controllers are considered in this work, namely \gls{PID}, \gls{LQR}, and \gls{MPC}.
    \gls{PID} control does provide active swing-damping of the payload, but it is used in the training data stage discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id}. 
    \gls{LQR} is a popular and well-known optimal control technique. 
    In previous work by \cite{Erasmus2020} and \cite{Slabber2020}, 
    an \gls{LQR} implementation with an parameter estimator was designed for active swing-damping control of a multirotor with an unknwon suspended payload.
    This \gls{LQR} architecture was shown to be an effective swing-damping controller and will be applied in this work as the baseline controller.
    
    \paragraph
    A data-driven system identification method was introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id} to estimate a linear model of unknown dynamics.
    The models generated by this method will be used in an \gls{MPC} for active swing-damping control of the multirotor and payload system. 
    The proposed \gls{MPC} architecture will therefore be compared to the baseline \gls{LQR} controller.
    These swing-damping control architectures are summarised in Table~\ref{tbl:controller_summary}, where each controller is paired with a system identification method.

    \paragraph
    In this chapter, an overview of the different controllers will be given and the design process of each controller will be explained.
    A MATLAB/Simulink simulation environment will also be introduced to test these controllers.
    The controllers will be tested in simulations with different system paramaters and with distrubances.
    Finally, the simulation results will be shown and discussed.
