        \paragraph
        After the system identification phase, active swing damping control can be applied
        to the multirotor and payload system.
        The control architectures are summarised in Table~\ref{tbl:controller_summary} 
        by pairing the system identification techniques along with the appropriate controllers.
        It was firstly shown in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id} that the system identifcation techniques worked in simulation.
        % Emphasise that control is now applied in a full \gls{SITL} simulation.
        
        \FloatBarrier\subsection{Simple suspended payload}

            \paragraph
            The modelling assumptions of the white-box model discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:modelling} 
            defines a point-mass suspended with a rigid cable which is attached to the \gls{CoM} of the multirotor.
            This is a simplisitic suspended payload model but represents the dynamics of many practical payloads well.
            In this section, the simulated payload model complies will all these assumptions.
            The simulation model used in this section was verified with practical data in Section~\ref{sec:model_verification}.
            This is also the payload model used for simulations with an \gls{LQR} controller by \cite{Erasmus2020} and \cite{Slabber2020}

            \input{control/plots/compare_control_vel.tex}

            \paragraph
            From simulation results, it appears that both the MPC and LQR effectively damp the payload oscillations while controlling the velocity of the multirotor.
            Figure~\ref{fig:compare_control_vel} shows the velocity step responces of the MPC, LQR and PID controllers for a multirotor with a suspended payload.
            For the MPC and LQR, the respective models were first generated in the training phase of the simulation.
            Thereafter, the MPC and LQR were manually and iteratively tuned to produce a step response with a similar response time and overshoot.
            The PID response shown is with the same controller gains used in the training phase.
            
            \paragraph
            From Figure~\ref{fig:compare_control_vel} it is clear that both the LQR and MPC controllers actively damp the velocity oscillation caused by the swinging payload.
            The oscillations clearly continue for a long

            MPC:
            vel weight = 2;
            theta weight = 0;
            dtheta weight = 10; 
            mv weight = 1;
            mvrate weight = 5;
            Ty = 5;
            Tu = 3;

            LQR:
            LQR.Q = diag([10 10 0 100]); 
            LQR.R = 8
