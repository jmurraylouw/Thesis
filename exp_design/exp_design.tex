\chapter{Experimental design} \label{chap:exp_design}

    \paragraph
    As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:lit_study}, experimental data is a valuable part of any study involving multirotors control.
    This chapter will provide an overview of the hardware components, software toolchain, HITL simulations, and practical methodology used in this work.

    \FloatBarrier\section{Hardware components}

        \paragraph
        The hardware involved in this work include a multirotor vehicle, a custom-made payload angle sensor, and an \gls{OBC}.
        These hardware elements are coupled together into the final multirotor vehicle which will be used for practical flights.

            \end{figure}

            \paragraph
            The multirotor used in this work is a lightweight and modular quadrotor named \emph{Honeybee} which was developed in the \gls{ESL} at Stellenbosch University \cite{Grobler2020}.
            Figure~\ref{fig:honeybee} shows an photo of Honeybee equipped with an \gls{OBC} and payload angle sensor.
            Table~\ref{tbl:honeybee_specs} summarises the physical parameters of this multirotor system.
            Note that the mass and inertial parameters include the \gls{OBC} and payload angle sensor.
            The thrust profile of each motor is given by the third-order polynomial mapping the input \gls{PWM} signal, $x$, to the thrust output, $T_m$:
            \begin{equation}
                T_m(x) = -3.508 \cdot 10^{-9} x^3 + 1.627 \cdot 10^{5} x^2 - 0.0172 x + 4.528
            \end{equation}

            \paragraph
            The \gls{FC} implemented on Honeybee is a \emph{Pixhawk 4 mini} which runs the flight stack firmware.
            Figure~\ref{fig:pixhawk} shows what the Pixhawk 4 mini looks like.
            This board includes internal \gls{IMU}, magnetometer, and barometer sensors and is connected to an external \gls{GPS} sensor and an additional magnetometer.
            Furthermore, an \gls{RC} receiver is used to communicate with a radio transmitter for manual pilot control and a telemetry radio module is used for communication with a ground control station.
            The \gls{OBC} and external payload angle sensors are also connected to the \gls{FC}.

        \FloatBarrier\subsection{Payload angle sensor}

            \paragraph
            A sensor is required to measure the payload state as Euler angles about the $\bm{\bar{x}}_\mathcal{B}$ and $\bm{\bar{y}}_\mathcal{B}$ axes.
            Figure~\ref{fig:payload_state_sensor} shows a customised sensor attached to the Honeybee airframe for this purpose.
            
            \begin{figure}[ht]
                \centering

                \label{fig:payload_state_sensor}
            \end{figure}

            \paragraph
            This sensor was constructed from a two-axis joy-stick and two linear potentiometers.
            Each potentiometer is implemented as a voltage divider and attached to an \gls{ADC} channel on the \gls{FC}. 
            An experiment was performed to map the \gls{ADC} reading to an angle measurement with a straight line function, which is implemented on the \gls{FC}.
            A cable can then be attached to this device to transport a suspended payload and measure the swing angles during flight.

        \FloatBarrier\subsection{On-Board Computer}

            \paragraph
            An \gls{OBC}, also called a companion computer, is used to run intensive computational processes that cannot be handled by the \gls{FC}.
            A NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Jetson Nano\texttrademark, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:jetson}, is used as the \gls{OBC} for Honeybee.
            This has 4GB 64-bit LPDDR4 memory and a quad-core ARM A57 processor which runs at 1.43 GHz.
            The \gls{OBC} is connected to a serial port on the \gls{FC} for communication.

    \FloatBarrier\section{HITL} \label{sec:exp_design_hitl}

        \paragraph
        MATLAB is used to generate an \gls{MPC} \gls{ROS} node 
        This \gls{ROS} node receives state feedback from the Gazebo simulator,
        computes the optimal control action,
        and sends the setpoint to PX4 through the package 'mavros'.

    \FloatBarrier\section{Practical flights}
        
        \paragraph
        As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:system_id}, 
        generating data for the parameter estimation techniques involves two distinct flight stages.
        Firstly, the multirotor hovers with the suspended payload to gather data for payload mass estimation.
        A velocity step setpoint is then commanded to stimulate the swinging payload system for cable length estimation.
        Hence, the same methodology used for simulations will be used for practical flights.

        \paragraph
        For the data-driven techniques, the generation of practical training and testing data
        also follows the same general methodology as simulated flights:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Data logging starts when the multirotor is armed
            \item Takeoff and hover with the multirotor
            \item Command velocity step setpoints
            \item Land the multirotor
            \item Data logging stops when the multirotor is disarmed
            \item Download the data log from the multirotor
            \item Split the data into separate training and testing periods
            \item Build a model from the training data
            \item Perform model predictions over the testing data to calculate an error metric
        \end{enumerate}

        \paragraph
        Figure~\ref{fig:honeybee_with_payload} shows the Honeybee multirotor with a suspended payload during a practical flight.
        Numerous flights were performed with different 
        payload masses, 
        cable lengths, 
        wind conditions, 
        and dynamic payloads.
        The system identification methods were then performed for these different use cases.
        
        \paragraph
        The major differences between the simulated and practical flights involve the attachment of the payload and wind disturbances.
        In simulations, the payload cable is attached to the exact \gls{CoM} of the multirotor.
        However, for practical flights the cable is attached slightly below the \gls{CoM} of Honeybee due to mechanical constraints.
        Practical flights are also influenced by wind disturbances which were not considered in simulations.
        The measurement noise experienced by a practical multirotor may also differ from the noise models used in simulations.
